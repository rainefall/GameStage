# GameStage
.. is a C# game framework designed for building games from scratch, based on FNA, a reimplementation of Microsoft XNA.

Like most of my video game projects, it is currently nowhere near production ready. Please also note that GameStage is x64 only.

## Setup
Clone this repository and add GameStage.csproj to your C# solution. You will also need to manually install FNA's non C# binaries, which can be found [here](https://fna.flibitijibibo.com/archive/fnalibs.tar.bz2) (or you can compile them yourself). Simply place them in the directory your application compiles to.
